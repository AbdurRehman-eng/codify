      "description": "In this problem, your task is to create a function that accepts two integers as input and returns their sum. The sum of two numbers is calculated by simply adding the two values together. You need to implement a function sumTwoNumbers(a, b) that takes two integers a and b as input and returns their sum.\n\nFor example, if the input values are 3 and 5, the sum is calculated as 3 + 5, which equals 8. Similarly, for -1 and 4, the sum is -1 + 4, which equals 3.\n\nThe function should be simple and handle both positive and negative integers. Ensure that the function works correctly with a variety of inputs, such as zero or negative numbers, as shown in the examples below.\n\nExample:\n\nFor input 3 and 5, the function should return 8.\n\nFor input -1 and 4, the function should return 3.\n\nFor input 0 and 0, the function should return 0.",
